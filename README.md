# Singly Linked List:

A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list. Is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.


## Challenge:
Well the challenge is to create three methods from scratch without using built in methods

## Approach & Efficiency:
The apporach i took today is iterative while building and the BigO notation is O(n) 

## API:
The three methods used are:
1. Insert: Allows the user to add nodes or data to their linkedlist 
2. Includes: Allows the user to check for specific element in the linked list.
3. toString: it allows the result to shown in cool way

## WhiteBoard For Linked List:

## Approach & Efficiency:
Those three methods that are added thier time complexity is O(n) and space as well
