## Approach & Efficiency
Well the approach was used in the arrayShiftInsert is iterative apporach and the time complexity is o(n).


# Binary Search:

##  Approach & Efficiency
Well the approach that i used in binary search is the Iterative apporach and the time complexity of this approach is O(logn).


# Fibonacci Sequence:

## Code Challenge 4 Whiteboard:

##  Approach & Efficiency
Well the approach that i used in Fibonacci Sequence is the Iterative apporach and recursive approach as well  and the time complexity of Iterative approach is O(n) and for recursive is O(2^n).
