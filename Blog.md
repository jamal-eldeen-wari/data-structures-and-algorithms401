# Insertion Sort:

is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

## First Three Passes:

### Effeciency:
**Time Complexity: O(n^2)** 
**Auxiliary Space: O(1)**
